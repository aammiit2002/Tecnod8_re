Narrator: Welcome to the Techfest Task Whiz 2023-2024 video presentation. Today, we will discuss our project "Intelligent Task Allocation" that uses AI algorithms to allocate tasks efficiently. Let's get started!

[SLIDE 1: TITLE]

Narrator: Our project aims to develop an AI algorithm for fair task distribution by analyzing individual strengths, workload, and deadlines.

[SLIDE 2: SOLUTION]

Narrator: Our solution dynamically assigns tasks based on historical data, abilities, and previous team members' work. We collect and preprocess data, analyze it for predictive insights, and allocate tasks accordingly.

[SLIDE 3: DESIGN]

Narrator: We use Python with libraries like Numpy, Scikit-learn, and Pandas. Our tech stack includes MySQL, Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJs for seamless task management.

[SLIDE 4: PARAMETERS]

Narrator: We consider employee qualifications, technical skills, years of experience, preferences, and peer ratings for task suitability and fair allocation.

[SLIDE 5: LIMITATIONS]

Narrator: Our solution's limitations include limited understanding of team cohesion and potential for limited adaptability to changing project requirements and team dynamics.

[SLIDE 6: FUTURE SCOPE]

Narrator: In the future, we plan to enhance collaboration, develop adaptive task allocation, integrate with project management tools, leverage data-driven decision-making, and focus on continuous improvement.

[SLIDE 7: THANK YOU]

Narrator: Thank you for watching our video. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us. Have a great day!
